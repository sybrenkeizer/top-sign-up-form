# top-sign-up-form

**Features:**
- Responsive web design
- Validation for all input fields
- Comprehensive password validation:
  - Tooltip with criterea
  - Criterea are dynamically updated during input
  - State of criterea have a clear visual communication
- Layout and styling closely resembles assignments' template


**Difficulties (and to be improved):**
- CSS: Marking consecutive elements with border reveals some parent elements break off much before children are finished. This is not visible on the finished product but internally positioning of elements seem incorrect. Ideally parent elements completely encapsulate their children.
- JS: Code seems very redundant.
  - Work on using shorter variable names in future
  - Work on less repetition of same or similar functionalities
